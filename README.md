Revisit to project. This time focusing on DOM manipulation and events within JavaScript. Making use of querySelector, createElement, addEventListener, and appendChild functions. These were used to read input from buttons on the webpage that corresponded with a move in game. Create divs with text telling the player who won the round and the current score for both players after each round.
